Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.Language used to communicate with a computer.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.Contains tools such as Java Virtual Machine, Java Compiler and Java Runtime Environment.
JVM- Enables a computer to run a Java program.
Java Compiler- Takes a ".java" java file and compiles it to ".class" file which then can be read by the computer.
JRE- Holds JVM and all its libraries.

What is IDE?
A.Integrated Development Environment

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.Eclipse,Intellij,Netbeans,etc

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.Java code is written, saved as a .java file, it is then taken and put through the java compiler,
which then converts it into a .class file which can be executed.

what is class?
A.Blueprint of an object.

What is object?
A.Instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A.The Main Method [public static void main (String [] args) ]

Why main is static?
A.Main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made. Since it is static it can
be directly invoked via the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.Object Class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Path is the environment variable, where we specify the locations of the JDK binaries,
While a ClassPath is an environment variable, which is used by the java compiler to find the path.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.Interface cannot have implementation, while a abstract class can have abstract class
can have abstract methods, which can be implemented.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.No, you have to extend an Abstract class and implement an interface to a concrete class.

what is Access Specifier?
A.Level of access to a class,method,constructor,variable,etc...

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.Object Oriented Programming. Abstraction- Implementation hiding.
Encapsulation- Accessing private variables using public method.Data hiding.
Polymorphism- Taking objects in many forms.Inheritance- Is a mechanism in which one object
acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.A Java package groups a group of classes. java.lang packaged is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.Application Programming interface. A list of all the classes that is part of JDK.
We used API of BufferedReader, FileReader,Scanner,FileReader,String,Math,Random etc...

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.No, you can only inherit from one class, to void problems with overwritten similar methods
in multiple classes.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.Same method in one class, but different parameters. It happens when we change the signature
of a particular method.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.It is an event which occurs during the execution of a program which disrupts the program's
instructions. It is handled by try and catch block,finally keyword, or by throwing exceptions.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods?
A.Static keyword that is used for sharing the same variable or method of a given class.
We can use static method and variables by direct call and by class name.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.Once a variable is declared final, its value cannot change. It will establish the
values for variables and methods and they cannot be overridden.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.Final class cant be inherited,final method cant be overriden and
final variable value cant be changed. Finally is used to place important code,
it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finalize is used to perform
clean up processing just before is garbage collected.

What is a constructor?
A.Initialize an object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.Yes

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.Default Constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.Keyword "this" is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A."Super" keyword is used to call the constructor, methods and properties of a parent class.
Super can be used to refer immediate parent class, instance variable.
Super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
Super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

What is JVM stand for?
A.java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
Yes

What version of java are you using?
Java version "11.0.1"

What is JAR stand for?
A.Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.JDK is a kit,which provides the environment to develop(run) the Java program.
JVM is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it contained or inbuilt in both.
Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for
executing the Java program line by line hence it is also known as interpreter.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.JVM is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing
the Java program line by line hence it is also known as the interpreter.
JRE is an installation package,which provides environment to only run(not develop) the java program
(or application) onto your machine.

What is compile time and run time?
A.The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become an executable program.
This compilation process is referred to as compile time. A compiled program can be opened and run by
a user... The terms "runtime" and "compile time" are often used by programmers to refer to different
types of errors.

What is heap?
A.Heap is part of RAM,where all the objects reside.

How java manage it's memory?
A.By allocating memory to new Java objects and de-allocation memory from unused objects.
In Java,memory management happens automatically and memory allocation and de-allocation happens in
the background.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String cannot be used by two threads simultaneously. String once assigned cannot be changed.
StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object.
StringBuilder is the same as StringBuffer,that is it stores the object in heap and it can also be
modified. The main difference between StringBuffer and Stringbuilder is that StringBuilder is also
not thread safe.

What is Singleton class?
A.A Singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access
to that created instance.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java
object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
A.The rule is,when a variable is marked as transient,its object wont be serialized during
serialization. A transient variable is a variable that may not be serialized.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.Only difference between these two loops is that, in while loops,test expression is checked
at first,but in do while  loop code is executed at first, then the condition is checked.

What is Enum?
A.A Java Enum is a special java type used to define collections of constants.

What is Iterator?
A.An Iterator over a collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeratin in the Java Collection
framework.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.If String were not immutable,a connection or file would be changed and lead to serious security
threat.Mutable strings could cause security problem in reflection too,as the parameters are strings.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with
respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.The serial collector is the simplest one, and the one you probably wont be using,as its mainly
designed for single-threaded environments and small heaps.
Serial Collector is mostly designed for single-threaded environments.
Parallel Garbage Collector is used for multi-threaded environments.

What is JIT stands for?
A.Just In Time Operator

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.Java objects reside in an area called the heap.The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may
increase or decrease in size,while the application runs.
Garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory,identifying which objects are in use and
which are not, and deleting the unused objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.No

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.Stack is LIFO,Queues is FIFO. Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application, whereas
stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.Whenever an object is created,its always stored
in the heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.The code can be written against known interfaces,but the actual classes to be used can be
instantiated using reflection from configuration files.

what is multithreading in java?
A.Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.So,there is a need to synchronize the action of multiple threads and make sure that only one thread
can access the resource at a given point in time.

What is Framework?
A.A framework is a collection of programs that do something useful and which can use to develop your
own applications.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.Selenium,Arquillian,JTest,The Grinder,TestNG,JUnit,Jwalk,mockito,Powermock.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.Difference between Junit and testNG are:
TestNG is a testing framework inspired from Junit,but introducing some new funtionalities that
make it more powerful and easier to use.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.TestNG,Junit,Maven

what is dependency injection in java?
A.Dependency injection is a technique whereby one object(or static method) supplies the dependencies
of another object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.Static binding in Java occurs during compile time,while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
